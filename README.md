Hello and welcome!

here i have written some code for the common challenge which is FizzBuzz, Ive written it in Python and here i will explain my reasoning for writing my code this way!

First of all we started by defining a function called fizz_buzz and passed an input into the parentheses of this function.
Within this function we have a series of if statements, i chose the if statements rather than doing if, Elif and else as it makes the code more linear.
The first if statement is the more complex and specific statement as i noticed an errro happening when i pass the value of 15 into the print function. This helps the code start with the more specific condition and if its not met it moves onto the simple conditions.
Here i utilise the Modulus to see if a number is divisible by the given number within the if statement equals to zero then it will return the specific string. The strings being "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3 "Buzz" if divisible by 5 and "Fizzbuzz" if divisible by both.
The program will return the number if it isnt divisible by any of the numbers and will prevent any errors.

If there is any way i can improve my code feel free to let me know!

have a great day and thanks for reading!
